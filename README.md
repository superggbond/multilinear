# multilinear     

## Overview
This R package is a practice for the coursework Biostat 625 at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, which provides comparible analytical results to R built-in functions for multiple linear regression:     
* `mlr()`outputs a list of analytical results, including a summary table of coefficients, model-fitted response values, residuals of response based on the model, variance-covariance matrix and ANOVA results.     
* `coefs()`provides a brief comparible estimates of all coefficients.      
* `select.cov()`selects covariates passing a given threshold of significance.
